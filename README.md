<h1>🧭 Real-Time Navigation System using Intel RealSense + YOLOv8</h1>

This project implements a real-time obstacle-aware navigation assistant using an Intel RealSense depth camera, YOLOv8 object detection, and text-to-speech feedback.
It detects objects, measures their distance using depth data, and provides navigation commands such as Move Forward, Move Left, Move Right, or Stop.

<h2>🚀 Features</h2>

🎯 YOLOv8 Object Detection (real-time)

📏 Depth-based distance estimation using Intel RealSense

🗣 Voice feedback via Text-to-Speech (TTS)

🧠 Simple navigation logic (left / center / right)

🖥 Live visualization with bounding boxes and distances

⚡ Optimized for real-time performance
